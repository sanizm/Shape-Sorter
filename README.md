# Shape-Sorter
The software project is about generating random six shapes and sorting them according to their surface area. 
The functionality to load the shapes randomly with random colors and sizes and sorting them is implemented through two buttons. 
The first button with the name “Load Shapes” has the functionality to load six shapes namely a Circle, Square, Rectangle, Oval, Semi-Circle, 
YRectangle (or vertical rectangle). The sizes of these shapes are random with a threshold set which is the range in which the size of a particular 
shapes can be maximum or minimum. The second button with the name “Sort Shapes” has the functionality to sort all of the six shapes according to the
surface area they cover. A sorting method technique is used to sort these shapes, so it used Insertion Sort to sort them.
